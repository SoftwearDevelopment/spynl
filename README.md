Spynl is a Python web framework which extends the  [Pyramid](http://getpyramid.com) web framework.

**Spynl helps you to manage your web application:**

* **Build** your app (via [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io))
* **Deploy** your app (via [Docker](<https://www.docker.com/what-docker))
* Serve **endpoint documentation** for frontend devs (via [Swagger](http://swagger.io/))
* **Inspect** settings and meta-data of running instances in the browser
* **Aggregate** performance indicators and error messages in [NewRelic](https://newrelic.com) and/or [Sentry](https://sentry.io)

Spynl also has a few other in-built utilities which are often necessary in a modern professional web application but easily take a few days to get right:

* Manage translations (via [Babel](http://babel.pocoo.org))
* Send templatable, translatable HTML emails
* validate JSON input and output with Schemas

Please [read the docs](http://spynl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
